# JIN's Personal Blog (# a.k.a attempt to learn React & more Javascript)

Currently @ AWS EC2 Instance: http://bloggingjin.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/#/blog?_k=3rwaq4
You can check my previous, currently postponed, outdated attempt [here.][df1]


# New Features!

  - CR of CRUD working.
  - AWS S3 Upload, fetch working (for image uploading)
  - AWS DynamoDB, very basic setup working.




### Tech

This is peronsal project to try to touch upon all the hot & modern web development tools. All of these technologies were self-taught:

* [React.js] - Client-side, the most popular front-end tool!
* [Node.js] - Awesome Javascript & evented I/O for the backend!
* [Webpack] - Bundler, still very newbie at it.
* [Sass] - Sassy CSS, very cool and helpful.
* [Express] - Fast node.js network app framework
* [jQuery] - well...



### Todos

 - Full CRUD ? This is a maybe, since I personally don't need it.
 - Refactor AWS.configure & some repetitive client-side url fetching (ex. AWS Signed URl fetch)
 - Create Local Secondary Index for sepearte Blog fetches (index page & show page).
 - Deploy onto Heroku (but first better UI)
 - Add actual Blog Post.

> Long way to go, but a start it a start :)
